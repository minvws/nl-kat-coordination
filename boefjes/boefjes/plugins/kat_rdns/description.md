Reverse DNS (Domain Name System) is a method of converting an IP address back to the corresponding domain name. While regular DNS translates domain names (e.g., example.com) to IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1), reverse DNS performs the reverse function.

Reverse DNS works by attaching an IP address to a domain name by creating a special domain name that follows a specific format. This special domain name is called a "reverse DNS lookup" or "PTR record" (Pointer record). The PTR record is stored in a special zone called the "in-addr.arpa" zone.
