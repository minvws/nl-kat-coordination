# PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION pins the Playwright npm package and, via `playwright install`
# below, the browser it downloads. The base image is pinned by tag + digest so it
# is immutable and Dependabot-trackable (a plain tag can't be, see #3261). The
# digest is authoritative (Docker ignores the tag when a digest is present), so on
# a version bump update the base tag, the digest and PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION together.
