# RFD 0002: Code of Conduct: Code Review

## Introduction

Code reviews are an essential part of the software development process,
ensuring that the codebase remains clean, efficient, and maintainable while
fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members. For both
authors and reviewers, approaching code reviews with the right mindset and
strategies can significantly improve the quality of the code and the efficiency
of the review process.

By adhering to these best practices, both authors and reviewers can contribute
to a more effective and enjoyable code review process, ultimately leading to
higher-quality software and stronger team dynamics.

Having a code of conduct for code reviews can help set expectations, establish
a positive and respectful environment, and ensure that the review process is
productive and beneficial for all team members.[^2]

## Authors

1. **Mind your reviewer**

   Make choices or options that minimize time and cognitive load for the reviewer,
   such as opting for multiple short changes instead of one massive one.

2. **Satisfy preconditions**

   Ensure that your code is ready for review before you send it, and if you feel that it is not entirely there yet please mark it as 'draft' to signal this to potential reviewers:

   - It should work and is able to run,
   - There should be no unresolved merge conflicts,
   - Have adequate testing that pass,
   - And respect the style and coding guidelines.

   Consider validating this by performing a self-review. This is respectful of
   reviewer time and can sometimes save you a review round trip. If you're
   looking for an early review then make this clear.

   Try to make a habit to review early and often, and to ask for feedback early.
   When you feel that you could use some input on your draft PR then ask for it.
   This can help you to avoid costly mistakes and rework later on.

3. **Provide context**

   When opening a PR for review be clear to your reviewer about your
   expectations. In terms of the review, this means specifying in the description of the PR, the kind of
   reviewing as well as who should review what using which level of scrutiny
   and rigor.

   Add comments or give explanations with your code about the thought process,
   and show what choices you've made and why.

   Be cognizant that enough context is provided for the reviewer to understand
   the changes you've made.

   When necessary schedule a call or a meeting to discuss the changes in more
   detail, and walk the reviewer through the changes.

4. **Remember that communication can be hard**

   Difference in understanding or opinions are to be expected in the context of
   code review. Always assume competence and goodwill from the reviewer, and that
   the other person has your best interests (and those of your project) at heart.
   As with giving feedback, receiving feedback requires that the author is open
   to **constructive** criticism and feedback.

## Reviewers

1.  **Look for the following**

    As a reviewer look for the following in a pull request[^1]. In no particular
    order:

    1.1 _Design_

    Does this change integrate well with the rest of the system? Is it
    consistent with the existing design and architecture?

    1.2 _Functionality_

    Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is the way the code
    behaves good for its users? This includes the users of the software as
    well as the developers who will be working with the code. Think about
    edge cases, look for concurrency problems, try to think like a user,
    and make sure that there are no bugs that you see just by reading the
    code.

    1.3 _Complexity_

    Is the change more complex than it needs to be? **Too complex** usually
    means: "can't be understood quickly by code readers". It can also
    mean "developers are likely to introduce bugs when they try or modify
    this code".

    Be cautious of over-engineering, where developers make the code more
    generalized than necessary or include features that aren't currently
    required. Encourage developers to address the problem that needs
    solving right now, rather than focusing on a potential issue that might
    arise in the future.

    1.4 _Tests_

    Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests? Ask for
    unit, integration, or end-to-end tests as appropriate for the change.

    Will the tests actually fail when the code is broken? If the code
    changes, will they begin to produce false positives? Do the tests make
    clear and meaningful assertions? Are they appropriately divided across
    different test methods?

    Keep in mind that tests are also code that needs maintenance. Avoid
    allowing complexity in tests just because they aren't part of the main
    codebase.

    1.5 _Naming_

    Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods,
    etc.? Does the name accurately describe the purpose, behavior, and
    intent of the code it represents?

    1.6 _Style and Conventions_

    Does the code follow our style and coding guidelines? Are there any
    violations of the style guide?

    1.7 _Consistency_

    Preferably the author should maintain consistency with the existing code.
    This includes consistency in naming, style, structure, and design patterns.

    This makes sure that the codebase is easier to understand and maintain.
    When a substantial change should be made to the existing code that would
    cause inconsistencies, it should be discussed with the team, and be
    addressed in a separate issue.

    1.8 _Comments_

    Are the comments clear and useful? Do they explain why the code is
    written in a certain way? Do they explain the intent behind the code?
    Are they up-to-date?

    1.9 _Documentation_

    Did the developer also update relevant documentation? This includes
    README files, API documentation, and any other relevant documentation.

2.  **Assume competence and goodwill**

    Be positive, polite and respectful.

3.  **Keep your feedback constructive and actionable**

    Be helpful and constructive in your feedback. If you see something that
    could be improved, suggest a way to improve it. Don't only just point out
    what's wrong, but also suggest how to fix it, for example by utilising the "add suggestion" feature in review comments.

    When there is the possibility to lend out a helping hand, do so. Schedule
    a call or a meeting to discuss the feedback in more detail. This can help
    to clarify the feedback and to make sure that the author understands the
    feedback. It also helps to keep up the pace, and potentially avoid multiple
    review round trips.

4.  **Explain the why**

    Some code might seem wrong to you, but it's likely not obvious to the
    author, or they wouldn't have written it that way. So please don‘t say
    "This is wrong".

    Instead, explain at least what the right way looks like. Or even better,
    explain why they should do things differently. And if you’re the slightest
    bit uncertain, "Maybe I'm missing something, but..." is a helpful sentence.
    Remember, assume competence.

5.  **Find an end**

    If you like things neat, it‘s tempting to go over a code review over and over
    until it’s perfect, dragging it out for longer and taking more time than
    necessary. It‘s soul-deadening for the recipient, though.

    Keep in mind that "LGTM" does not mean "I vouch my immortal soul this will
    never fail", but "looks good to me". If it looks good, move on. That
    doesn’t mean you shouldn‘t be thorough. It’s a judgment call.

    And if there are bigger refactorings to be done or new feature that need to
    be addressed. Then move them to a new issue.

    Especially when there are multiple reviewers, and multiple review rounds,
    it's important to find an end to the review process. Different reviewers
    may have different opinions, and it's important to find a balance between
    the different viewpoints.

6.  **Mention the positives**

    It‘s easy to get into the mindset of "find ALL the flaws", but
    acknowledging the positives both helps maintain civility and brightens the
    recipient’s day.

    No need to be all fake smiles, but if there's a good
    decision, or if somebody takes on a really grungy task, acknowledging that
    is a nice thing to do. And on the converse, a "thank you" to the reviewers
    is occasionally a nice thing, too.

    When you see something cool, when you see a good decision, or when made
    a change that is interesting or innovative, mention it!

7.  **Don't shame people**

    "How could you not see this" is a very unhelpful thing to say. Assume that
    your colleagues do their best, but occasionally make mistakes. That's why
    we have code reviews - to spot those mistakes. While flawless PR's are
    awesome, flawed ones are the norm.

8.  **Don't use extreme or very negative language**

    Please avoid saying things like "no sane person would ever do this" or
    "this approach is terrible", "I can't imagine anyone would want to
    implement it like this".

    Thinly veiled insults or passive aggressive comments are not helpful and
    can be damaging to the relationship. This is useless, petty and nearly
    impossible to act on. While it might intimidate the reviewee into doing
    what you want, it’s not helpful in the long run - they will feel incapable,
    and be less inclined to collaborate with you in the future, and there is
    not much info in there to help them improve.

    "This is a good start, but it could use some work" or "This needs some
    cleanup" are nicer ways of saying it. Discuss the code, not the person.

9.  **Don't bikeshed**

    Always ask yourself if this decision really matters in the long run, or if
    you‘re enforcing a subjective preference. It feels good to be right, but
    only one of the two participants can win that game. If it’s not important,
    agree to disagree, and move on. Remember that the goal of the code review
    is to improve the code, not to enforce your personal preferences.
