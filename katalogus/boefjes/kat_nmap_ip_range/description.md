# Nmap IP-range

This boefje checks an IP range/NetBlock and stores any IP addresses that seem to be active.

### Options

This Nmap boefje has the following hardcoded options:

| Option | Function                                     |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `T4`   | assume a fast and reliable network           |
| `Pn`   | skips host discovery, treats hosts as online |
| `-r`   | scan ports in order                          |
| `-v10` | use verbosity level 10                       |
| `-oX`  | Output in XML                                |

For TCP `-sS` is used, for UDP `-sU` is used. Both have their own TOP_PORTS argument.

### Input OOIs

Nmap expects an NetBlock as input.

### Output OOIs

Nmap outputs the following OOIs:

| OOI type    | Description                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| IPAddressV4 | IPv4                                             |
| IPAddressV6 | IPv6                                             |
| IpPort      | Open ports of IpAddress                          |
| Service     | Services that are found                          |
| IpService   | IpService that couples a service to an open port |

The boefje uses the same normalizer and structure as the generic `kat_nmap` boefje.
