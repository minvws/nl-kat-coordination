What is OpenKAT?
================

OpenKAT aims to monitor, record and analyze the status of information systems. The basic premise is that many of the major security incidents are caused by small errors and known vulnerabilities, and that if you can find them in time your systems and infrastructure become a lot more secure.

OpenKAT scans, collects, analyzes and reports in an ongoing process:

OpenKAT scans networks, finds vulnerabilities and creates accessible reports. It integrates the most widely used network tools and scanning software into a modular framework, accesses external databases such as shodan, and combines the information from all these sources into clear reports. It also includes lots of cat hair.

OpenKAT is useful if you want to monitor a complex system and want to know whether it contains known vulnerabilities or configuration errors. Due to its modular structure and extensibility, OpenKAT can be applied in a multitude of situations. You can customize it and put it to your own use.
