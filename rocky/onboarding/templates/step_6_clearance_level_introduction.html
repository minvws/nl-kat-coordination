                        Some scans are lightweight while others might be a bit more aggressive with their scanning.
                        OpenKAT requires you to set a clearance level for each object to prevent you from unintentionally
                        running aggressive scans. For example you might have the right to run any type of scan on your own server but you
                        probably donâ€™t have the right to do so for objects owned by other organizations.

                        Each plugin that scans has a scan levels.
                        The scan level of a plugin must be equal to or below the clearance level you set for your object for it to scan.
                        Clearance levels on objects and scan levels for plugins are indicated with little cat paws.

                                This plugin has a scan level of 1, requiring a level 1 clearance level of objects to be run.
                                This means that the scan does not touch the object itself, but only searches for
                                information about the object.

                                This plugn has a scan level of 3, requiring a level 3 clearance of objects to be run.
                                This means that the scans are intrusive and more aggressive. Depending on what you scan, things could break.
