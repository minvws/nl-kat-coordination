            Some scans are lightweight while others might be a bit
            more agressive with their scanning.
            OpenKAT requires you to set a clearance level
            for each object to prevent you from unintentionally
            running agressive scans. For example you might have the
            right to run any type of scan on your own server but you
            probably donâ€™t have the right to do so for objects owned
            by other people of companies.

            Each plugin that scans will have a scan intesity score. The intesity of the scan must be equal to or below the clearance level you set for your object. If the scan has an intesity level that is too high, OpenKAT will notify you before running it. Visually clearance levels and intesity scores are indicated with little cat paws.

                This scan has a scan intensity score of 1, requiring a level 1 clearance level to be run.
                This means that the scan does not touch the object itself, but only searches for information about the object.

                An example of a more agressive scan. Which has a scan intesity score of 3.
                Meaning it requires at least a level 3 clearance level to be set on your object.

            After creating a new object OpenKAT will ask you to set a clearance level.
            On the object detail page you can always change the clearance level.
            For the onboarding we will suggest to set the clearance level to L2.
