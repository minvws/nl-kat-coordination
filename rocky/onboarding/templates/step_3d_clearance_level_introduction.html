                        Some scans are lightweight while others might be a bit more aggressive with their scanning.
                        OpenKAT requires you to set a clearance level for each object to prevent you from unintentionally
                        running aggressive scans. For example you might have the right to run any type of scan on your own server but you
                        probably donâ€™t have the right to do so for objects owned by other people of companies.

                    you have been granted access to scan objects using Boefjes with a maximum scan level of L{{dns_report_least_clearance_level}}.
                    Before utilizing this clearance level, you must acknowledge your trusted status as an L{{dns_report_least_clearance_level}} clearance level holder.
