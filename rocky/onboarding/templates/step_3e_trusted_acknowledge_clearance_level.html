                    OpenKAT has a permission system that allows administrators to
                    configure which users can set a certain clearance level. The will make sure
                    that only users that are trusted can start the more aggressive scans.

                    Before a member is granted the ability to set clearance levels on an object,
                    they must first acknowledge and accept the clearance level set by the administrators.
                    The maximum scanning level permitted for a member is aligned with the trusted clearance level.
                    By acknowledging the trusted clearance level, this member formally agrees to abide by
                    this permission and gains the capability to perform scans only up to this trusted clearance level.
                    This two-step process ensures that the member operates within authorized boundaries.
