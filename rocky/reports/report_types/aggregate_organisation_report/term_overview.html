                            Web servers and domains are examples of digital assets within this framework.
                            Web servers are essential for hosting and serving websites or web applications,
                            while domains represent the online addresses used to access these resources.
                            Other examples of assets in the IT realm include databases, user accounts,
                            software applications, and networking infrastructure. Asset management is a
                            critical aspect of cybersecurity, involving the identification, classification,
                            and protection of these assets to safeguard against threats and ensure the overall
                            security and functionality of an organization's IT environment.

                            Multiple hostnames that resolve to one IP address where at least one

                            A fundamental component of the client-server model. A web server uses protocols
                            like HTTP or HTTPS to facilitate communication between clients and the server.

                            A mail server is a specialized software application or hardware device that facilitates
                            the sending, receiving, and storage of emails within a computer network.
                            Operating on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for outgoing messages and
                            either Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or Post Office Protocol (POP) for
                            incoming messages, a mail server manages email communication by routing messages between
                            users and storing them until they are retrieved. The server ensures the efficient and
                            secure transfer of emails, handling tasks such as authentication, spam filtering, and
                            message storage.

                            A nameserver, or Domain Name System (DNS) server, is a critical component of the internet
                            infrastructure responsible for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses,
                            enabling the seamless navigation of the web. When a user enters a domain name in a web browser,
                            the nameserver is queried to obtain the corresponding IP address of the server hosting the associated
                            website or service.

                            A DICOM server, which stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine,
                            is a specialized server designed for the storage, retrieval, and exchange of medical images and
                            related information in the healthcare industry. DICOM is a widely adopted standard that ensures
                            interoperability and consistency in the communication of medical images and associated data among
                            different devices and systems, such as medical imaging equipment, picture archiving and
                            communication systems (PACS), and radiology information systems (RIS). DICOM servers store and
                            manage patient-specific medical images, like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, utilizing a standardized format.
