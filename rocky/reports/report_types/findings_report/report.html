                The Findings Report provides an overview of the identified findings on the scanned
                systems. For each finding it shows the risk level and the number of occurrences of
                the finding. Under the 'Details' section a description, impact, recommendation and
                location of the finding can be found. The risk level may be different for your
                specific environment.
