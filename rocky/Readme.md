## Rocky (nl-kat)

Rocky is part of the openKAT project, made with Django.
See [nl-kat-coordination](https://github.com/minvws/nl-kat-coordination) for more details about openKAT.

## Stack

As said, Django is the framework for this project.
To comply to government standards, use [Manon](https://github.com/minvws/nl-rdo-manon) for style and accessibility.
Yarn is used as package manager and ParcelJS is used as bundler to compile the frontend (CSS and Javascript).
You can find the Manon repository here: [https://github.com/minvws/nl-rdo-manon](https://github.com/minvws/nl-rdo-manon)
