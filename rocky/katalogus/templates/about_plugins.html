                            Plugins gather data, objects and insight. Each plugin has its own focus area
                            and strengths and may be able to work with other plugins to gain even more insights.

                            Boefjes are used to scan for objects. They detect vulnerabilities,
                            security issues, and give insight. Each boefje is a separate scan that
                            can run on a selection of objects.

                            Normalizers analyze the information and turn it into objects for the data model in Octopoes.
