      Some scans are lightweight while others might be a bit
      more agressive with their scanning.
      OpenKAT requires you to set a clearance level
      for each object to prevent you from unintentionally
      running agressive scans. For example you might have the
      right to run any type of scan on your own server but you
      probably donâ€™t have the right to do so for objects owned
      by other people of companies.

      Before you're able to add assets to OpenKAT and to assign clearance levels,
      you have to give indemnification on the organization and declare that you as a person can be held accountable.
