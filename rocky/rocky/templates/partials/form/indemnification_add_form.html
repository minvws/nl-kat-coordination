            Performing security scans against assets is generally
            only allowed if you have permission to scan those assets.
            Certain scans might also have a negative impact on (your)
            assets. Therefore it is important to know and be aware of
            the impact of security scans.

            OpenKAT requires you to set a clearance level for each object
            to prevent you from unintentionally running aggressive scans.
            For example you might have permission to run any type of
            scan on your own server but you probably donâ€™t have permission
            to scan objects owned by other people or organizations.

            Before you're able to add assets to OpenKAT and assign clearance levels,
            you have to give an indemnification to the organization and
            declare that you, as a person, can be held accountable if things go sideways.
