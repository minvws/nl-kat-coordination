Working with objects
====================

Adding an initial object with an appropriate safeguard puts OpenKAT to work. This can be done in on-boarding, but objects can also be added individually or as CSV files. Objects are also referred to as 'objects of interest' or OOI. The object itself contains the actual data: an objecttype describes the object and its logical relations to other objecttypes.

Properties
----------

Objects can be viewed via the 'Objects' page in OpenKAT's main menu. Here are the already created objects with the type and safeguard level for each object. Objects can be added, scanned, filtered and there is an export option.

New objects can be created via the 'add' option. This can be done individually or per CSV. The specification of the CSV is included on the page where it can be provided.

Start scan
----------

Based on the object and the clearance, OpenKAT provides an overview of available boefjes. All users can perform a manual scan appropriate to the given safeguard level. The manual scan is accelerated by the scheduler. The results appear as findings with the object.

View Findings
-------------

Findings appear on the general findings page, but can also be viewed by object.
