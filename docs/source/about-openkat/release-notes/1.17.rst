============================================
OpenKAT 1.17
============================================

This release adds flexible scheduling, which will allow us to schedule periodic report
generation next to running Boefjes on custom intervals. We also added structured
JSON logging and audit trails to various user actions allowing for precise monitoring
of user actions. Searching and sorting of object lists has been implemented, and
a cross-organization task-list has been included for users who have access to
multiple organizations.

Support for adding custom boefjes is continuously improving and the same holds true for
Report generation.

We also migrated to Django 5, and upgraded various dependencies to keep in line with
their latest (security) updates.

Upgrading
=========

All bits all need to be rerun because of model changes. This can be done on the
organization settings page.

Running the Origin Migration
================================
Upon upgrading, one migration needs to be triggered manually.
This is the `boefjes/tools/upgrade_v1_17_0.py` script, which you can run in your ``boefje`` environment using:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m tools.upgrade_v1_17_0

Or more concretely, using Docker:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker compose run --rm boefje python -m tools.upgrade_v1_17_0

And using the Debian packages, either as the `kat` user or root depending on your configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    source /opt/venvs/kat-boefjes/bin/activate
    export $(cat /usr/lib/kat/boefjes.defaults | grep -v "#") && export $(cat /etc/kat/boefjes.conf | grep -v "#")
    cd /opt/venvs/kat-boefjes/lib/python3.11/site-packages
    /opt/venvs/kat-boefjes/bin/python -m tools.upgrade_v1_17_0

Please check the logs for any errors in the migration.
The script can be run multiple times in case unexpected errors appear, although some warnings are to be expected.
After running the script (ideally once), the next run should log that `total_processed=0` and `total_failed=0`.
