==========================
Test or develop via GitPod
==========================

Through Gitpod, anyone (with a github, gitlab account) can quickly start up and test an OpenKAT environment. Gitpod offers a basic test environment that allows you to build OpenKAT directly from the repository.

Gitpod test environment
=======================

Access the `Gitpod test environment through this link <https://gitpod.io/#github.com/minvws/nl-kat-coordination>`_

The installation will be done from the repo, so you get a fresh install. Add your own account to OpenKAT during the installation process. Once started, the Rocky interface will be available on the service running on port 8000.
