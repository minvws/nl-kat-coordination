Pages
*****

The user interface of OpenKAT consists of the following pages (or top tabs), which provide access to various functionality and data:

- **Crisis Room:** The Crisis Room provides an overview of organizations. There are two different Crisis Rooms one provides access to *all your organizations* and there is a Crisis Room *for each organization.*
- **Katalogus:** The Katalogus is a catalog which contains all the plugins that can be enabled and disabled within OpenKAT. If you want to scan your objects, you have to enable the right plugins first.
- **Findings:** The Findings page gives an overview of all your findings.
- **Reports:** The Reports page allows you to generate, view and schedule various reports.
- **Objects:** The Objects page contains an overview of all the objects that are added manually, or were identified through the scanning process.
- **Tasks:** The Tasks page contains an overview of all tasks and their status (e.g. completed and failed). Task data can be viewed for Boefjes, Normalizers and Reports. The raw files (data) from all tasks can be downloaded here.
- **Members:** The Members page contains an overview of all the users that have access to the selected organization, including their roles, status and clearance level.
- **Settings:** The Settings page allows you to add tags to the organization, add the scanning indemnification and decide to rerun all bits.
- **User settings:** Clicking in the top right corner on your account, allows you to access the 'My Organizations', 'Profile' settings page and session logout.

Each of the above-mentioned pages will go into depth on the functionality and working of that page.
