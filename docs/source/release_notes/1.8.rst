Development containers
----------------------

The development Docker Compose configuration has been changed from four
PostgreSQL containers with one database each to a single container with four
databases. In addition, PostgreSQL is upgraded from version 12.8 to version 15.

If you don't need to keep the data in your development instance you only need to
update your .env. If you do want to keep the data you need to dump the databases
with the following commands before you update the git repository (the commands
need to run using the old docker-compose.yml):

.. code-block:: sh

    docker-compose exec bytes-db pg_dump -U postgres bytes > bytes.sql
    docker-compose exec katalogus-db pg_dump -U postgres katalogus > katalogus.sql
    docker-compose exec rocky-db pg_dump -U postgres rocky > rocky.sql
    docker-compose exec scheduler-db pg_dump -U postgres scheduler > scheduler.sql

In .env, you need to change ROCKY_DB_HOST to "postgres" and also change
BYTES_DB_URI, KATALOGUS_DB_URI, SCHEDULER_DB_DSN to use "postgres" as hostname
by changing the "@{bytes,katalogus,scheduler}-db:5432/" part to
"@postgres:5432/".

After that you can pull in the changes you can start the new PostgreSQL
container using:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker-compose up -d postgres

And load the dumps back in with psql:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres bytes < bytes.sql
    docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres katalogus < katalogus.sql
    docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres rocky < rocky.sql
    docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres scheduler < scheduler.sql
