Upgrading
=========

Containers
----------

The Docker Compose configuration has been changed from four PostgreSQL
containers with one database each to a single container with four databases.
In addition, PostgreSQL is upgraded from version 12.8 to version 15.

To migrate your data from separate containers to the new single container setup,
you can run |pg_dump|_ using ``docker-compose exec`` on the four PostgreSQL
containers. After creating a new PostgreSQL 15 container, use |psql|_ to restore
your data into the new container.

.. |pg_dump| replace:: ``pg_dump``
.. _pg_dump: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html
.. |psql| replace:: ``psql``
.. _psql: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-psql.html
