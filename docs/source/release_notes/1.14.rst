============
OpenKAT 1.14
============

Our final release for 2023 introduces a whole slew of report types build using
our new reporting functionality. These specific (TLS, mail, basic security,
etc.) reports can be combined into aggregated reports for one or multiple assets
from a single organisation. Another great addition is the first steps into what
we would like to call Federated OpenKAT. You can export reports of any kind and
re-import these into another organisation for further processing, keeping in
line with out usual process each of these imported reports is timestamped and
stored in the bi-temporal storage paving the way to compliance over multiple
organisations, assets or vendors. We are looking forward to providing easier
user-interfaces and broader support for in future releases but we feel these
first steps are a good start. Let us know if you have any feedback on what we
have already implemented.

uWSGI has been replaced by Granian by default. See the :ref:`1.13 release notes
<OpenKAT 1.13>` release notes for more information. You can still switch back to uWSGI
in 1.14 if Granian does not work. uWSGI support will be removed in 1.15.

The pydantic version used by OpenKAT has been updated to version 2. Pydantic v2
has big improvements in performance which should also result in OpenKAT speed
improvements.

In line with our policy this will be the last release to have Debian 11
packages. If you are still running Debian 11 you need to upgrade to Debian 12 to
be able to upgrade to 1.15.

Upgrading
=========

The normal instructions for upgrading :ref:`Debian packages<Upgrading Debian>`
or upgrading :ref:`containers <Upgrading_Containers>` should be followed.

Debian packages
---------------

Because of the switch to Granian, we can't listen on both 8000 and 8443 anymore,
and we will default listen only on port 8000 on 127.0.0.1. If you were
previously accessing OpenKAT using https on port 8443 you need to change the
configuration as described on the :ref:`Debian installation page<Configure
reverse proxy>`.
