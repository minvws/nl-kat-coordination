============
OpenKAT 1.11
============

This release has a major refactor of the environment variables used to configure
OpenKAT. Every variables has been reviewed and defaults changed, naming has been
made more consistent and datatype validation improved. Most importantly, you can
now find comprehensive documentation about all environment settings at
:ref:`Environment settings`. This documentation is now automatically generated
from the source code itself and should always be fully up-to-date with the main
branch.

This release also includes backwards compatibility for the old variable names
for most settings. We recommend to check your configuration files and rename
them. OpenKAT will log a warning if you use the old variable names instead of
the new ones.

A new boefje, normalizer and bit for TLS Ciphers has been added. Findings will
be created when support for old TLS ciphers are detected. The severity of the
findings created follows the current policy of the Ministry of Health, Welfare
and Sport.

A few scripts have been added that make it easier to install, upgrade and debug
OpenKAT on Debian. See :ref:`Scripts` for more information. Thanks to Rob
Musquetier for contributing the scripts.
