============================================
OpenKAT 1.17
============================================

This release adds flexible scheduling, which will allow us to schedule periodic report
generation next to running Boefjes on custom intervals. We also added structured
JSON logging and audit trails to various user actions allowing for precise monitoring
of user actions. Searching and sorting of object lists has been implemented, and
a cross-organization task-list has been included for users who have access to
multiple organizations.

Support for adding custom boefjes is continuously improving and the same holds true for
Report generation.

We also migrated to Django 5, and upgraded various dependencies to keep in line with
their latest (security) updates.
