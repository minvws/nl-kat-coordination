===========
OpenKAT 1.9
===========

Basic support for Config OOIs has been added. Not every organization has the
same policy and also different objects might need different treatment and Config
OOIs will provide an easy way to change the behaviour of bits. The first
configurable parameter is the max age of the HSTS header in the
check_hsts_header bit. More configurable parameters will be added in the future.

Performance improvements have been made in several areas. Support for
OpenTelemetry has also been added to get better insight into performance. Work
on more performance improvements is still ongoing.

New Features
============

 * Improved raw output download in case of boefje/normalizer crashed.
 * Openmetric endpoint has been added to bytes and mula.
