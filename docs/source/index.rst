Welcome to the OpenKAT documentation!
=====================================

The OpenKAT website can be reached via `this link <https://openkat.nl>`_.

The documentation is divided into four parts:

- **About OpenKAT**: Here you can read all about what OpenKAT is.
- **User manual**: Learn how to use OpenKAT in the interface (non-technical).
- **Installation and deployment**: All the information you need for the installation and deployment of OpenKAT.
- **Developer documentation**: Do you want to contribute as a developer, check the documentation here!

Below you find the table of contents for the full OpenKAT documentation. You can also use the search bar or the side bar to navigate the documentation.

If you are stuck, or believe the documentation is incorrect, you can make a ticket on `our GitHub repository here <https://github.com/minvws/nl-kat-coordination>`_.
