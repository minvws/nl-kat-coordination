Reports
=======

With the Reports functionality you can create reports with a specific focus.

There are 3 different kinds of reports available. These are:

- **Normal report:** selecting one or more reports will show the contents of each report below each other. These reports can be exported as PDF.
- **Aggregate report:** selecting one or more reports will show aggregated data for each selected report. This means that some results are aggregated to provide a general overview of the current compliance status of the scanned objects. These reports can be exported as PDF and JSON.
- **Multi report:** allows you to compare one organisation with another based on the organisation tags. This is only possible for aggregate reports. A multi report is very similar to an aggregate report, but shows data across multiple organisations. These reports can be exported as PDF.

The table below gives an overview of the 12 reports available. It also describes which Object needs to be selected and whether the report is available as a normal and/or as an aggregate report.

Report flow
===========
On the Reports page you can generate new reports and get an overview of all generated reports. With the button 'Generate report' you get into the Report flow wizard, which can be used to choose your report, objects and plugins that are required for the report. Please note that enabling plugins during the report flow wizard will result in inaccurate data, as the plugins will take some time before they have gathered and analyzed all data. Check the Tasks page to verify that all tasks have completed.


Plugins
=======
Each report has both required and suggested plugins that are used to show data in the report. These plugins are shown in the report flow. You can still generate reports if not all required plugins are enabled, however a warning a message is shown and the generated report will show that not all required plugins were enabled at the time of generation.


Downloading and/or exporting a report
=====================================
The normal and multi report can be downloaded as PDF file. The aggregate report can be exported as a PDF and also as a JSON file. Just click the 'Download' or 'Export' button on the right. The JSON output can be used to create a Multi-Report and compare organisation sectors.


Generating a Multi Report
=========================
With the Multi report you can compare organisations, for example if both are similar health care institutions.
Create two organisations and make sure both organisations have data. For this tutorial they are named `CAT` and `DOG`.

#. In `CAT` generate an ‘Aggregate Report’ and export this to JSON format. Repeat this step for `DOG`.

#. Create a third organisation called `BIRD`.

#. In `BIRD`, go to Objects > Add > ‘Upload raw file’.

#. Upload both raw files (from `CAT` and `DOG`) using the mime-type openkat/report-data’. (the mime-type will be auto-prefilled if you navigate to the upload page from the report normalizer.

#. Click on ‘Reports’ and click on ‘Multi Report’.

#. Select the report data of the organisations `CAT` and `DOG` and follow the report flow steps to generate the report. If you do not see your uploaded reports please make sure you have cleared the filter first.



Troubleshooting
===============
When you do not see one (or more) of the reports options, please check the following things:

- Do you have the required object selected? (This is either the Hostname or IPService for all reports, except the findings report.)
- Does your selected object have sufficient clearance? Generally L2 or higher is required.
