# Boefjes

This module has several entry points discussed below, but let us first consider the prerequisites and scope.
If you already have a running setup and want to learn where each bit of functionality goes, read the following page:

[Developing Openkat Plugins](../introduction/makeyourown.rst)

## Prerequisites

To run a development environment you need to have:

- A running RabbitMQ service
- A running Bytes API service
- A `./env` containing the environment variables explained below
- Everything in the `requirements.txt` installed

Optionally, you could have an instance of the octopoes api listening on a port that receives the normalized data from
the normalizers.

## KATalogus

See the openAPI reference at http://localhost:8003/docs.
The KATalogus has CRUD endpoints for several objects such as:

- `Organisation`
- `Plugin`
- `Setting`

### Organisations

Supported HTTP methods (for CRUD): `POST`, `GET`, `DELETE`.
Includes an endpoint that lists all objects.
All subsequent objects in the API are namespaced on the `organisation_id`.

### Plugins

Supported HTTP methods (for CRUD): `GET`, `PATCH`.

### Settings

Supported HTTP methods (for CRUD): `POST`, `GET`, `DELETE`, `PUT`.
Includes an endpoint that lists all objects.

The KATalogus stores environment settings for the different organisations and plugins, accessible through the API.
These can be encrypted by setting the `BYTES_ENCRYPTION_MIDDLEWARE=NACL_SEALBOX`, and the public and private key env vars.
More info about the encryption scheme can be found here: https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public/.
Currently, the settings are encrypted when stored, and returned decrypted.
This could be changed in the future when the boefje-runner/plugin-code can decrypt the secrets itself,
although this would be more complicated.

## Environment variables

By design, Boefjes do not have access to the host system's environment variables.
If a Boefje requires access to an environment variable (e.g. `HTTP_PROXY` or `USER_AGENT`), it should note as such in its `boefje.json` manifest.
The system-wide variables can be set as environment variable to the boefjes runner by prefixing it with `BOEFJE_`.
This is to prevent a Boefje from accessing variables it should not have access to, such as secrets.
To illustrate: if `BOEFJE_HTTP_PROXY=https://proxy:8080` environment variable is configured, the Boefje can access it as `HTTP_PROXY`.
This feature can also be used to set default values for KAT-alogus settings. For example, configuring the `BOEFJE_TOP_PORTS` environment variable
will set the default value for the `TOP_PORTS` setting (used by the nmap Boefje).
This default value can be overridden by setting any value for `TOP_PORTS` in the KAT-alogus.

## Technical Design

Boefjes will run as containerized workers pulling jobs from a queue in the Scheduler:

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant Boefje
    participant Rocky
    participant Scheduler
    participant Normalizer
    participant Bytes
    participant Octopoes
    Boefje->>+Scheduler: Get Boefje Task
    Scheduler-->>Scheduler: boefje_task.status = DISPATCHED
    Boefje->>Scheduler: boefje_task.status = RUNNING
    Boefje-->>Boefje: Run Boefje Task
    Boefje->>Scheduler: boefje_task.status = COMPLETED
    Boefje->>Bytes: Save Raw
    Bytes-->>Scheduler: Raw File Received
    Scheduler->>Scheduler: Push Normalizer Task
    Normalizer->>Scheduler: Get Normalizer Task
    Scheduler-->>Scheduler: normalizer_task.status = DISPATCHED
    Normalizer->>Bytes: Get Raw
    Normalizer->>Scheduler: normalizer_task.status = RUNNING
    Normalizer-->>Normalizer: Run Normalizer Task
    Normalizer->>Scheduler: normalizer_task.status = COMPLETED
    Normalizer->>Octopoes: Add object(s)
```

The connection between the Scheduler and Bytes is managed asynchronously through RabbitMQ.

### Boefje and Normalizer Workers

When we configure a `POOL_SIZE` of `n`, we have `n` + 1 processes: one main process and `n` workers.
The main process pushes to a `multiprocessing.Manager.Queue` and keeps track of the task that was being handled by the workers.
It sets the status to failed when the worker was killed,
like when the process [runs out of memory and is killed by Docker](https://github.com/minvws/nl-kat-coordination/pull/1187).
(Note: `multiprocessing.Queue` will not work due to [`qsize()` not being implemented on macOS](https://github.com/minvws/nl-kat-coordination/pull/1374).)
No maximum size is defined on the queue since we want to avoid blocking.
Hence, we manually check if the queue does not pile up beyond the number of workers, i.e. `n`.

#### Parallel Workers

The setup for the main process and workers:

```{mermaid}
graph LR

SchedulerRuntimeManager -- "pop()" --> Scheduler

subgraph Process 0

  multiprocessing.Queue
  SchedulerRuntimeManager -- "put(p_item)" --> multiprocessing.Queue["multiprocessing.Manager.Queue()"]

  Worker-1["Worker 1<br/><i>target = _start_working()"] -- "get()" --> multiprocessing.Queue

  subgraph Process 1
    Worker-1
    Worker-1 -- runs --> Plugin1["Plugin"]
  end

  Worker-2["Worker 2<br/><i>target = _start_working()"] -- "get()" --> multiprocessing.Queue

  subgraph Process 2
      Worker-2
      Worker-2 -- runs --> Plugin2["Plugin"]
  end
end
```

#### Sending a SIGKILL to a worker process

A representation of the failure mode when a SIGKILL has been sent to the worker (also see `boefjes/app.py`):

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
  participant SchedulerRuntimeManager
  participant SharedDict
  participant Queue
  participant Worker[pid=1]
  participant Scheduler
  participant Worker[pid=2]
  Worker[pid=1]->>SharedDict: set: SharedDict[1] = p_item.id
  Worker[pid=1]->>Worker[pid=1]: receives SIGKILL
  SchedulerRuntimeManager->>Worker[pid=1]: if not is_alive()
  SchedulerRuntimeManager->>SharedDict: set p_item_id = SharedDict[1]
  SchedulerRuntimeManager->>Scheduler: set p_item_id status to FAILED
  SchedulerRuntimeManager->>Worker[pid=1]: close()
  SchedulerRuntimeManager->>Worker[pid=2]: start()
```

Here, the `SharedDict` maps worker process IDs (PIDs) to the task they are handling.

### Running as a Docker container

To run a boefje and normalizer worker as a docker container, you can run

```bash
docker build . -t boefje
docker run --rm -d --name boefje boefje python -m boefjes boefje
docker run --rm -d --name normalizer boefje python -m boefjes normalizer
```

Note: the worker needs a running Bytes API and RabbitMQ. The service locations can be specified with environment variables
(see the Docker documentation to use a `.env` file with the `--env-file` flag, for instance).

### Running the worker directly

To start the worker process listening on the job queue, use the `python -m boefjes` module.

```bash
$ python -m boefjes --help
Usage: python -m boefjes [OPTIONS] {boefje|normalizer}

Options:
  --log-level [DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR]
                                  Log level
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

So to start either a `boefje` worker or `normalizer` worker, run:

- `python -m boefjes boefje`
- `python -m boefjes normalizer`

Again, service locations can be specified with environment variables.

### Example job

The job file for a DNS scan might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "b445dc20-c030-4bc3-b779-4ed9069a8ca2",
  "organization": "_dev",
  "boefje": {
    "id": "ssl-scan-job",
    "version": null
  },
  "input_ooi": "Hostname|internet|www.example.nl"
}
```

If the tool runs smoothly, the data can be accessed using the Bytes API (see Bytes documentation).

### Manually running a boefje or normalizer

It is possible to manually run a boefje using

```shell
$ ./tools/run_boefje.py ORGANIZATION_CODE BOEFJE_ID INPUT_OOI
```

This will execute the boefje with debug logging turned on. It will log the raw
file id in the output, which can be viewed using `show_raw`:

```shell
$ ./tools/show_raw.py RAW_ID
```

There is also a `--json` option to parse the raw file as JSON and pretty print
it. The normalizer is run using:

```shell
$ ./tools/run_normalizer.py NORMALIZER_ID RAW_ID
```

Both `run_boefje.py` and `run_normalizer.py` support the `--pdb` option to enter
the standard Python Debugger when an exceptions happens or breakpoint is
triggered.

If you are using the standard docker compose developer setup, you can use
`docker compose exec` to execute the commands in the container. The boefje and
normalizer containers use the same images and settings, so you can use both:

```shell
$ docker compose exec boefje ./tools/run_boefje.py ORGANIZATION_CODE BOEFJE_ID INPUT_OOI
```

For example:

```shell
$ docker compose exec boefje ./tools/run_boefje.py myorganization dns-records "Hostname|internet|example.com"
$ docker compose exec boefje ./tools/show_raw.py --json 794986d7-cf39-4a2c-8bdf-17ae58f361ea
$ docker compose exec boefje ./tools/run_normalizer.py kat_dns_normalize 794986d7-cf39-4a2c-8bdf-17ae58f361ea
```

### Boefje and normalizer structure

Each boefje and normalizer module is placed in `boefjes/<module>`. A module's main script is usually called `main.py`,
and a normalizer is usually called `normalize.py`, but it also may contain one or more normalizers.
A definition file with metadata about the boefje is called `boefje.py`.
Here a `Boefje` object that wraps this metadata is defined, as well as `Normalizer` objects that can parse this Boefje's output.
Each module may also have its own `requirements.txt` file that lists dependencies not included in the base requirements.
Furthermore, you can add static data such as a cover and a description (markdown) to show up in Rocky's KATalogus.

#### Example

```shell
$ tree boefjes/plugins/kat_dns
├── boefje.json
├── cover.jpg
├── description.md
├── __init__.py
├── main.py
├── normalize.py
├── normalizer.json
└── schema.json
```

### Tests

To run the unit test suite, run:

```shell
$ python -m pytest
```

For the KATalogus integration tests, run:

```shell
$ make itest
```

To lint the code using pre-commit, run:

```shell
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```
