Introduction
============
OpenKAT is an open source project. This means that anyone can help to make OpenKAT better. Even better.... we would LOVE for you to contribute! It can be daunting to find ways to contribute. By giving some examples, we hope you know what fits your specific skills and thus what way you can contribute best.

- Make bug reports for bugs you run into.
- Create pull requests to fix the bug report (you just created ;)).
- Create new boefjes, normalizers, bits and/or questions/configs. Some examples could be to implement support for all the nmap-scripts, PingCastle, snmp-walk, enum4linux, nbtscan, dirb, gitleaks, Recon-AD, implement OVAL lists from distributions to determine which software is outdated. Need more ideas? Ping us. ;)

The sections in this chapter help you get familiar with how OpenKAT works as a team/project. If anything is unclear, you just found a way to contribute.
