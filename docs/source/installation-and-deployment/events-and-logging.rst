Events and Logging
==================

For Events we use CRUDE (create, read, update, delete, execute) as specified in the NEN7513.

Different routes have different ranges of Event Codes, the ranges are as follows:

- login_event: 0900** & 09XXXXX, where XXXX = 1111, 2222, 3333 etc.
- file_action: 7000**
- ooi_change: 80000* - 80001* & 10050* & 90023*
- plugin_change: 80002* - 80003*
- job_change: 80005*
- report_change: 80007*
- schedule_change 80008*
- report_recipe_change 80009*
- dashboard_change 90030*
- dashboarddata_change 90030*
- account_change: 9001**
- organization_change: 90020* 0 90021* & 9*0000
- indemnification_change: 90022*
- observation_change: 10010*
- declaration_change: 10020*
- affirmation_change: 10030*
- origin_change: 10040*

\* differentiates from the suggested event code.

Proposition
-----------

The proposition is to use the event code with ``PCCCEE``, where:
- P = Project
- CCC = Category
- EE = Event

Projects (Root Folder)
----------------------

- Boefjes - scanners and normalizers = 5
- Bytes (raw data storage) = 6
- Mula (scheduler) = 7
- Octopoes (datamodel) = 8
- Rocky (Front-End) = 9

Category (Action / Sub Folder)
------------------------------

- login_event = 000
- account = 001
- organization = 002
- crisis_room = 003
- katalogus = 004
