=============================================

The iRealisatie Secure Development Pathway (`iSDP <https://github.com/minvws/rdo-isdp/tree/main>`_) is a pathway based on the OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 (Application Security Verification Standard).
The ASVS aims to provide a framework for improving the security of web applications by offering a detailed checklist of security requirements.
It serves as a security manual that helps developers and product owners understand what they should aim for to keep their applications secure.
