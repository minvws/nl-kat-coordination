        When a task hasn't run in a while it needs to be run sooner. We want
        a task to get a priority of 3 when `max_days` days are gone by, and
        thus it should have a lower bound of 3 for every day past those
        `max_days`. This is because priority 1 is reserved for rocky tasks,
        priority 2 is reserved for tasks that have not run yet for created
        ooi's.

        So everything before those `max_days` to the grace period are given a
        priority from `max_priority` of the queue, up from 3. We calculate
        the priority starting from the `grace_period`, so we subtract that
        from our time delta between now and the `last_run` of the object
        onwards, since it everything before the `grace_period` won't be
        regarded anyway. So from that initial point (the end of the
        `grace_period`, x=0) we want to place the priority the lowest, thus
        the last place in the queue) which is our `maxsize`.

        Since we want to have a lower bound of a priority of 3, we will use
        an exponential decay function in decreasing form.
